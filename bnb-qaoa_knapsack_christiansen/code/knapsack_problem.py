class KnapsackProblem:
    """
    Class for construction and representation of instances of the knapsack problem.

    Only intended for 0-1 knapsack problems, i.e. only one knapsack, one constraint,
    integer-valued weights/costs and values/profits as well as the decision "take it 
    vs. don't take it".

    Furthermore only such instances are permitted for which all profits and all costs
    are non-negative integers, the capacity of the knapsack is a positive integer, 
    the sum of all weights exceeds the capacity and no single weight is larger than the 
    capacity (otherwise the optimal solution would trivially be given be including
    all items or a certain item could never be selected, respectively). 

    Attributes:
    profits (list): the profits (values) of the items 
    weights (list): the costs (weights) of the items
    capacity (int): the capacity of the knapsack
    total_weight (int): the sum of all weights
    number_items (int): the number of items
